## Project #1: To-Do App

### Rundown Of Funcionality:
On Page Loadup: Greeting To User. You May Make A New List (At Anytime) Or Open A List Created (At Anytime).

When The New List Button Is Clicked It Runs A Function That Removes All Divs Execpt For The Div That Lets You Name A New List. Once A List Is Named It Does A Full Reload So Then It Goes Back To The Home Page.

When A List Is Opened From The Dropdown It Removes All Unneeded Divs And Addes The Div To Show The List. You Will Be Able To Add Tasks, Edit Tasks, And Clear Tasks. As Well As Deleting The Opened List And Asking For Help (Takes You To The help.html Page For Basic Help). You Will Also Be Able To Rename The List. Everything is Editable.

When Renaming Tasks, Or Lists, The h or p Will Become Direcltly Editable By Using The editcontent=true Attribute. Then I Have A Watcher With A If & Else To Control The Edit Process.

The Use Of Function Has Been Used To Make Sure That I Only Need To Call It When Needed, In The Right Location.

The Use Of Bootstrap Has Been Used For A Bit More Styling.
